# Digital Currency Converter
## Moringa School Phase 1 Final Project
### The Basic Story of My Application
I aspire to work in fintech sector and this application seeks to give me a glimpse of what waits ahead. 
The application is a Digital Currency Converter that can be used in money transfer platforms, trading platforms, tax compliance platforms and in stock exchanges 
### The Core Features of My MVP
This application takes in user input, that includes:
 1. Amount in figures that is to be converted
 2. The currency to convert from
 3. The currency to convert to

After a selection of the currencies, a standard conversion rate meter is displayed for the user to better understand the inner workings of the application conversion process.

### Setup
For this application, I fetch exchange rates from a public (external) API called:
     _https://api.exchangerate.host/latest_
The UI from styling to implementation and functionality, it has been coded from stratch using HTML, CSS, JS.
